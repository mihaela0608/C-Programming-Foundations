# ⚙️ C Programming – Foundations & University Work

Welcome to my C programming repository.  

This repository documents my journey into low-level programming through university coursework and independent practice. It reflects my commitment to building strong fundamentals in software engineering by understanding how programs interact with memory, hardware, and the operating system.

## 🎓 About

I am currently at the beginning of my C programming course at university.  
This repository will gradually grow as I progress through the semester.

It includes:

- University assignments  
- Practice problems  
- Experiments with core C concepts  
- Structured solutions focused on clarity and correctness  

Rather than being a collection of random exercises, this repository represents the development of foundational thinking in programming.

## 🧠 Why C?

C is not just another programming language.  

It teaches:

- Manual memory management  
- Understanding of stack and heap  
- Pointers and memory addresses  
- Performance awareness  
- Precise control over program behavior

## 📚 What You Can Expect

As the course progresses, this repository may include:

- Variables and data types  
- Control structures (conditionals and loops)  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Arrays and strings  
- Pointers  
- Dynamic memory allocation  
- Structures  
- Basic algorithms  

More advanced concepts will be added as I advance academically.
